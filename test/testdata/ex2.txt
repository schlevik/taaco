Before writing code, you need to figure out the exact keystrokes and mouse clicks that will fill out the form once. The mouseNow.py script in Project: “Where Is the Mouse Right Now?” can help you figure out specific mouse coordinates. You need to know only the coordinates of the first text field. After clicking the first field, you can just press TAB to move focus to the next field. This will save you from having to figure out the x- and y-coordinates to click for every field.
